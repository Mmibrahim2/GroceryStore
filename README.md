# GroceryStore


Brief Project Description:
This application allows grocery store managers to add and remove foods products into and from their inventory stored in the XML format. The application will also check if the provided food name is valid (exists in the dataset) and warns the user if this is not the case before attempting to remove the item entirely or update its stock. Additionally, the user will be able to view an itemâ€™s attributes by its name and also list out all the items given a type. This application is based on a red-black tree that uses the string value of a food item as its value to designate its place in the tree. To allow removal of a grocery item, the red-black tree supports removing nodes from the tree.
